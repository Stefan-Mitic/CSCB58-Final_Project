So what is this?

We call it Guitar Hero 115. Why? DE2-115.... yes it's a crappy joke.

How'd we accomplish it?
1) The project was broken into 3 separate pieces.
2) Built each piece
3) Day of (April 5th) go to lab and test it, bug fix it. Panic.

Divisions:
1) everything in verilog/ is needed to play 1 track guitar hero using the led lights
2) everything in verilog/ani is needed to play the game with the VGA adaptor
3) everything in verilog/audio_module is needed to output the music via the aux adaptor
