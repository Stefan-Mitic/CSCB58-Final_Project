Project Title: Guitar Hero 115

Project Description:
A single song version of guitar hero, built on the DE2-115 board.

Proposal
-----------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
A single line of LEDs, loaded from some memory storage and shifted down to LEDR[0]. Once getting to LEDR[0], the player will have to click the button if LEDR[0] is on and not click it, should it be off.
The intent of this phase is to show a proof of concept, make sure that the Shifters can be loaded from a ram module.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
By the end of this lab, we should have some way to output audio on a single track AND something simple that can be displayed on the monitor.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
3 to 4 track of data, sycronized to the screen and allowing for the guitar hero game to be played.

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
Due to the way we're intending to work on our project, each week, we should have something better than the last. If something in a given week doesn't work out,
we can submit the work from week n-1.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board : 
Speakers, with a standard 3.5mm input and a monitor.

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
We've spent time learning about clocks, shifting, counters, hexidecimal displays and circuit logic. This project will incorporate much of what we've
learned in labs and lectures, all while allowing us the opportunity to design a complex circuit in verilog. 

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
Everyone, at some point, has played or been exposed to rhythm games. This project seeks to emulate something that anyone can pick up, play with and have fun.

Why did you personally choose this project?:
The keys on the DE2 board reminded us of the buttons in Guitar Hero. It also seemed like a reasonable goal to accomplish.

Updates
------------

We've written our first project proposal.
Week 1:
- Created a prototype for the animation of a peg moving down the screen on the VGA display using a counter to keep track of the location and movement of the object.
- Completed one track that is automatically shifted and tested through the LEDs on a counter.
- Wrote a complete game track that needs to be checked and tested.
- Started working on the audio output for the game by downloading Altera's Music Sythesizer Demonstration and removing unneccessary features from their verilog files.

Week 2:
-Prototype of one track completed using the DE2 board's LED's with Hex display as a scoreboard.
-Able to output audio and learned how to modify the notes being outputted. It now outputs the first few seconds of the Mario Theme.
-VGA display can now display 4 separate pegs moving down the screen. Now working on hardcoding each peg when/where to appear.
-Need to start putting together the VGA diplay, the audio, and the responsive part of the game together.
