Project Details

Project Title: Guitar Hero 115

Project Description:
A single song version of guitar hero, built on the DE2-115 board.

Proposal
-----------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
A single line of LEDs, loaded from some memory storage and shifted down to LEDR[0]. Once getting to LEDR[0], the player will have to click the button if LEDR[0] is on and not click it, should it be off.
The intent of this phase is to show a proof of concept, make sure that the Shifters can be loaded from a ram module.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
By the end of this lab, we should have some way to output audio on a single track AND something simple that can be displayed on the monitor.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
3 to 4 track of data, sycronized to the screen and allowing for the guitar hero game to be played.

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
Due to the way we're intending to work on our project, each week, we should have something better than the last. If something in a given week doesn't work out,
we can submit the work from week n-1.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board : 
Speakers, with a standard 3.5mm input and a monitor.

Updates
------------

<Example update. Delte this and add your own updates after each lab session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as (optional).
